# GeoReg

Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education levels are crucial for shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable development. Recent research increasingly utilizes satellite and aerial imagery as well as diverse web-based data, such as geospatial information, to estimate these indicators. A major challenge in this field is the scarcity of labeled data, particularly in developing countries where only a small number of samples may be available. To address this challenge, we introduce GeoReg, a regression model that incorporates these heterogeneous data by leveraging the prior knowledge of large language model (LLM). In our approach, the LLM acts as a 'data engineer', extracting informative features to enable effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, GeoReg employs the LLM to deliver contextual insights into the relationships between data features and the target indicator, categorizing their correlations as Positive, Negative, Mixed, or Irrelevant. These features are then fed into the linear estimator, trained with appropriate weight constraints tailored to each category. To capture nonlinear patterns among features, we further utilize the LLM to identify meaningful feature interactions and integrate them, along with nonlinear transformations, as additional inputs. Experiments conducted across three countries at varying stages of development demonstrate that GeoReg outperforms baselines in estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with limited data availability.
